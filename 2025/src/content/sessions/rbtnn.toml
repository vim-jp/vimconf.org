rbtnn is what you might call an SIer in Japan. These days, his main role is team management, so he doesn't get to write code as often.
That said, he worked across the stack throughout his career—from server-side and client-side development to embedded systems—making him a so-called full-stack engineer.
Vim has been his primary text editor for nearly 15 years, and he uses it to write code in almost any programming language.
He's contributed to Vim itself several times in the past, and this time, He'd like to introduce a feature he implemented called TabPanel, and share the background and motivation behind adding it.
