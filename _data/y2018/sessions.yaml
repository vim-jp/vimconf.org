    Although it may not be well known, Vim has a lot of useful standard features and many people use them from the plugin, but they can also be used directly.
    Certainly plugins are important for efficient use of Vim and have used many plugins so far, but I prefer standard features rather than plugins recently.
    In this session, I'll talk about specific method of migrating plugins to standard features, along with my own growth and changes in usage of Vim itself which is that reason.

    Discover what is happening internally when you switch modes, such as insert mode, normal mode, and operator-pending mode.
    This talk first revisits how modes are when you use Vim, then I'll let you dive into the Vim C implementation to see what's exactly happening there.
    I'll even show what modifications can be done when you make change, with using existing pull requests.

    This talk is both for Vim beginners and advanced users who don't always look at the Vim C implementation.

    What makes him a little bit different is that he uses Vim for over 20 years to live, and organizes couple of Vim communities, including founding this VimConf back in 2013.
    His major contribution to Vim is to create and maintain <a href="https://github.com/vim-jp/vital.vim">vital.vim</a>, the comprehensive Vim utility functions for Vim plugins.

    He currently lives in Tokyo, Japan and working at Quipper Ltd.
    Back then he lived in Vancouver, Canada, and he's going to move back there within a year.
    Besides programming, he worked on baking breads 🥖, and is focusing on preprocessing and cook fish recently.

    This presentation shows how I, with 5 year experience of using Vim, use Vim to do my day job.
    In this presentation I'll talk about plugins I use frequently, native features I like the most and the tips to make a terminal and Vim work along well.
    You'll take away some plugins and techniques you've missed.

    He's been doing Ruby/Rails development over the past five years with some
    experience of development with Go. He started using Vim just when he
    started his professional carrier, and is still learning to master Vim.
    While most of the time he uses Vim for application development, sometimes
    he does system administration work, and Vim really helps him to achieve
    goals efficiently. He thinks Vim is a daily power tools for every type of
    developer.

    従来テキストエディタは重厚なIDEの対するアンチテーゼとして好まれてきた側面がありました。しかしながら今日のソフトウェア開発においては、いわゆる動的言語の開発現場においてもIDEの有用性が認められ、生産性などの観点を重視して、テキストエディタではなくIDEが推奨される事例が増えています。
    そのような現状において、テキストエディタを使ってIDEに匹敵する言語サポートを得て開発するための手法、特に固有のエディタに依存せずにインテリジェントなPHP開発を実現するためのツール群と、EmacsとVimへの適用例について紹介します。

    Coming to grips with Vim script in Vim 8.x is more than a matter of familiarizing yourself with the features they introduce (e.g., timer, job control, and lambda expression).
    The challenge is learning to use those features effectively --- so that your plugin is correct, efficient, maintainable, and portable.
    That's where this talk comes in. It describes how to write modern asynchronous Vim plugins using modules in vim-jp/vital.vim.

    He has been using Vim about 10 years for daily work and is addicted to
    it. He helps people to make Vim plugins by development of vital.vim
    modules, a Vim script library produced by vim-jp.
    He developed and maintains Vim related plugins such as
    jupyter-vim-binding, gina.vim, suda.vim, gista.vim, and a lot more.

    Modal editing is an amazing, efficient and fun way to write code.
    However until now has required a trade off in terms of the UI/UX of your editor as this I think is not where vim's strengths lie.
    Oni is a typescript electron app that embeds neovim and essentially provides a modern GUI wrapper.
    We aim to preserve the text-editing experience of neovim whilst adding a nicer UI/UX as well as IDE features.
    This talk is about the Oni project, its current status and what we plan for Oni's future.

    I've started a new project <a href="https://github.com/rhysd/vim.wasm">vim.wasm</a>.
    This is a project to port Vim editor to WebAssembly (Wasm). Wasm is a new executable format for browser. Now Vim is running on browser.

    In this presentation, I will explain how/why I ported Vim to Wzsm as an experimental fork.
    Let me share my experience porting the historic editor (which has a history of over 25 years) to a brand new web thing (Wasm); what was done well and what was an essential challenge.
