    The Vim project has changed a bit within the last year for various
    reasons. The talk will describe what changed within the Vim project, how
    it is currently managed, what we have achieved so far, how Vim is now
    developed and what might be ahead in the future.

  bio: |-
    Christian Brabandt has been working in the IT industry for more than 20 years, mostly as consultant in various roles.
    He is currently employed with Ataccama and working as platform consultant in which role he has been using Vi(m) on several different platforms to support customers with their software stack.

    He got involved with Vim in the early 2000s and has been slowly becoming more and more active in the wider vim community from participating in various forums and mailing lists, Vim plugin development, bug reporting and later contributing patches regularly as well as helping with the infrastructure in the Vim project.
    Since 2023 he has become one of the main maintainers of the Vim project after the passing of long time leader and benevolent dictator for life Bram Moolenaar.

    By understanding the internal implementation of Vim script, we aim to explore more effective ways to write Vim script. As of 2024, there are two main implementations of Vim script: one by Vim and a derivative implementation by Neovim. Additionally, with the introduction of Vim9 script into Vim, the processing of built-in functions has become more complex due to the intertwined handling required for both scripts. In this presentation, we will delve into the internal workings of Vim script and Vim9 script, with the goal of empowering you to hack Vim script more effectively.

    Let's say you're writing code in an application project, and are suddenly alerted to an issue that requires you to fix a configuration file that resides in another infrastructure project. In such situations, you want to switch to the infrastructure project as soon as possible, and after fixing the issue, you want to return to what you were doing in the application project.
    In this talk, I will show my tricks and tips for switching between projects quickly and smoothly in Vim. I will also demystify the "Session" feature in Vim/Neovim, that is the key for switching between projects.

    Are you editing text at the speed of thought?
    I'm editing text at the speed of thought, but my thoughts often come to a standstill.
    By having an LLM write text for me during these pauses in thought, I can edit text faster than the speed of thought.
    In this presentation, I will share how to create a code generation plugin using a local LLM and the challenges involved.
    Let's actively develop similar plugins together and improve our productivity in Vim.

  bio: |-
    I'm a car enthusiast and programmer. I can develop collama.nvim a little. Collama.nvim is a Neovim plugin that uses a local LLM for code generation. I hope to see more development of collama.nvim and similar plugins.

    In the world of frontend development, VSCode currently reigns as the mainstream editor. 
    However, Neovim, with its high customizability and lightweight nature, has the potential to provide a development experience that rivals or even surpasses that of VSCode.

    This presentation will explore how to achieve a development experience superior to VSCode using Neovim. 
    We’ll cover LSP setup, AI-powered tools, and efficient workflows using macros, snippets, and terminal integration. 
    Practical techniques and browser integration will be demonstrated in a live coding session, showcasing how Neovim can significantly boost productivity in modern frontend development.

    ## Neovim plugin development, building your own plugins for fun and profit:

    Neovim's extensibility makes it a powerful platform for building custom plugins tailored to your unique needs.

    In this talk, I'll guide you through the process of developing Neovim plugins, from setting up your development environment to creating feature-rich extensions that enhance your editing experience and tips on how best to publish and maintain them.

    Whether you're looking to contribute to an existing plugin, automate your repetitive tasks, integrate neovim with other tools you use, or customize your editor's behavior, this session will equip you with the knowledge and tools to build your own Neovim plugins like a pro.

    All while having fun along the way!

    "Yet another"

    We programmers often encounter the phrase "Yet another." For example, a search for "Yet another" on GitHub will return around 37,000 repositories. Why do programmers love using this phrase so much? Personally, I often use it as a light-hearted excuse, as if to say, "Yes, I know I’m reinventing the wheel."

    Which brings me to what I’ll be discussing at VimConf 2024: a new "Yet another" fuzzy finder called Fall. Fully aware that I’m reinventing the wheel, I even started Fall’s README with "Yet another."

    Wise men say not to reinvent the wheel, but I can't help doing exactly that. In my presentation, I’ll explore the world of existing fuzzy finders, share what I look for in one, and discuss the design philosophy behind Fall.

    What is the dark deno powered?

    It is:

    * Complex

    * Hard

    * You need to configure all

    * Extensible

    * Created by denops.vim with Deno

    * Real minimal

    I introduce the plugins and my philosophy's.

  bio: |-
    I have been contributing to the Vim community for many years and have extensive knowledge of both the core application and plugins.
    As a regular presenter at VimConf in the past, I haven't had the opportunity to present for a long time due to the cancellation of VimConf. This time, to commemorate the revival of VimConf, I would like to introduce the plugins I have created and my plugin philosophy (real minimal) for the first time in a while.
